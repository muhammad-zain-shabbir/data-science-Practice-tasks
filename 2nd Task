# Credit Risk Prediction

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan. This is done by training a classification model using a real-world loan dataset.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Loan Prediction Problem Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset)
- The dataset includes features like:
  - `LoanAmount`
  - `Education`
  - `ApplicantIncome`
  - Other demographic and financial details

## 🧹 Tasks Performed

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Identified and handled missing values using:
  - **Mean** for numerical columns (e.g., `LoanAmount`)
  - **Mode** for categorical columns (e.g., `Gender`, `Married`, etc.)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized key features to explore relationships:
  - **Loan Amount Distribution** (Histogram)
  - **Education vs Loan Status** (Bar Chart)
  - **Applicant Income by Loan Status** (Box Plot)

### 3. Model Building
- Selected key features: `ApplicantIncome`, `LoanAmount`
- Applied **classification models**:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Decision Tree Classifier**

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated performance using:
  - **Accuracy Score**
  - **Confusion Matrix**

## 📊 Results
- **Logistic Regression Accuracy:** ~83%
- **Confusion Matrix:** Demonstrated good separation of approved vs. not approved

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **pandas** (for data handling)
- **seaborn & matplotlib** (for data visualization)
- **scikit-learn** (for model training and evaluation)
